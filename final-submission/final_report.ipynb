    "## Motivation\n",
    "Tropical Cyclones are some of the largest and most destructive natural phenomena to occur on the planet. These warm core storms form in the tropics (30-0 degrees N & S), driven by the relatively warm sea surface temperatures adn more dominant vertical motions in dynamics. (expand)\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "#### TC Best Tracks\n",
    "Best Track data is gathered from the NHC HurDat2 database (Landsea et. al, 200x), which conatins storm tracks for all Atlantic Basin TCs from 1951 to present, and is updated at the end of each season. Data is stored in a .txt file, contaning all necessary data for calculating model errors. Because the dataset is very large and some datapoints are encoded, we use the hurdat2parser.py library to save time writing a custom parser. The data quality is good, with no missing values in the data for the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season. Because the 2020 season was so active that greek letter storm names had to be used alongside the regular alphabetical namelist, we did encounter a limitation of this library, as it uses only the first letter of the storm name to extract data for a given storm. This was resolved by encoding the unique storm identifier codes into our parser function. \n",

    "### DATA CLASSES\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading in data\n",
    "Data for this study was stored in custom data classes, allowing us to perform calculations efficiently on as many storms as we wanted without requiring us to repeat various lines of code or define vast amount of functions in the main notebook that would clutter our analysis. This allows us to initialise all necessary data for a TC from just the filepath to a folder containing the csv files for the track. Given that some longer lived TCs have a large number of TIGGE track data files, this approach streamlines reading in data to a simple class constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we load the data for TC Laura. We call the initialiser function from the trackError module, and pass it the filepath to the TIGGE data. This function iterates through each file in the directory and calls another function which is built to extract and parse data for a specific storm. Documentation for these helper functions can be accessed either on the github at https://github.com/larantt/hurricane-verification or by calling the help() function on any of the helper functions:"
