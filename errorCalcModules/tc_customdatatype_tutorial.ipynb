    "This tutorial should cover how to use the custom data classes that I created for storing tropical cyclone (TC) track data from the Thorpex Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) and the HURDAT2 best track archive. This should dramatically simplify how information is stored in verification and also allows for some basic verification and comparison calculations to be done relatively simply.\n",
